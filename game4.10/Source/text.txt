later that day when the princess was sitting at the table something was heard coming up the marble stairs splish splosh splish splosh the sound came nearer and nearer and a voice cried let me in youngest daughter of the king
the princess jumped up to see who had called her now when she caught sight of the frog she turned very pale
what does a frog want with you demanded the king looking rather surprised
the princess hung her head when was sitting by the fountain my golden ball fell into the water this frog fetched it back for me because cried so much the princess started to cry again promised to love him and let him eat from my golden plate drink from my golden cup and sleep on my golden bed
the king looked at the frog and thought for a while before he spoke then you must keep your promise my daughter
the princess knew she must obey so she let the frog to come inside the frog hopped in after her and jumped up into her chair and straight onto the table now push your golden plate near me said the frog so that we may eat together as she did so the frog leapt onto her plate and ate up all her dinner which was just as well because the princess didnt feel much like eating
next the frog drank from her little golden cup until it was quite empty somehow the princess didnt feel at all thirsty either after the frog had finished he took one great leap and landed on the princesss knee go away you ugly cold frog she screamed will never let you sleep on my lovely clean bed
that made the king very angry this frog helped you when you needed it now you must keep your promise to him
very unwillingly the princess picked up the frog and carried him upstairs to her room when the frog hopped into the middle of her golden bed it was just too much for the princess she pushed the frog hard and it fell onto the floor as he fell he was changed into a handsome prince a spell had been cast on him by an evil witch and only the princess had the power to break it
the princess was speechless she felt very sorry indeed that she had been so unkind to the frog after a while the handsome prince and the princess were married and lived happily ever after
it was not long before someone knocked at the house door and called open the door dear children your mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of you but the little kids knew that it was the wolf by the rough voice we will not open the door cried they you are not our mother she has a soft pleasant voice but your voice is rough you are the wolf then the wolf went away to a shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk ate this and made his voice soft with it then he came back knocked at the door of the house and called open the door dear children your mother is here and has brought something back with her for each of you but the wolf had laid his black paws against the window and the children saw them and cried we will not open the door our mother has not black feet like you you are the wolf then the wolf ran to a baker and said have hurt my feet rub some dough over them for me and when the baker had rubbed his feet over he ran to the miller and said strew some white meal over my feet for me the miller thought to himself the wolf wants to deceive someone and refused but the wolf said if you will not do it will devour you then the miller was afraid and made his paws white for him truly this is the way of mankind
so now the wretch went for the third time to the house door knocked at it and said open the door for me children your dear little mother has come home and has brought every one of you something back from the forest with her the little kids cried first show us your paws that we may know if you are our dear little mother then he put his paws in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white they believed that all he said was true and opened the door but who should come in but the wolf they were terrified and wanted to hide themselves one sprang under the table the second into the bed the third into the stove the fourth into the kitchen the fifth into the cupboard the sixth under the washing bowl and the seventh into the clock case but the wolf found them all and used no great ceremony one after the other he swallowed them down his throat the youngest who was in the clock case was the only one he did not find when the wolf had satisfied his appetite he took himself off laid himself down under a tree in the green meadow outside and began to sleep
the wolf lifted the latch the door sprang open and without saying a word he went straight to the grandmothers bed and devoured her then he put on her clothes dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed and drew the curtains
little red cap however had been running about picking flowers and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more she remembered her grandmother and set out on the way to her
she was surprised to find the cottage door standing open and when she went into the room she had such a strange feeling that she said to herself oh dear how uneasy feel today and at other times like being with grandmother so much she called out good morning but received no answer so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains there lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face and looking very strange
oh grandmother she said what big ears you have
the better to hear you with my child was the reply
but grandmother what big eyes you have she said
the better to see you with my dear
but grandmother what large hands you have
the better to hug you with
oh but grandmother what a terrible big mouth you have
the better to eat you with
and scarcely had the wolf said this than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up red cap when the wolf had appeased his appetite he lay down again in the bed fell asleep and began to snore very loud
the huntsman was just passing the house and thought to himself how the old woman is snoring must just see if she wants anything so he went into the room and when he came to the bed he saw that the wolf was lying in it do find you here you old sinner said he have long sought you then just as he was going to fire at him it occurred to him that the wolf might have devoured the grandmother and that she might still be saved so he did not fire but took a pair of scissors and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping wolf when he had made two snips he saw the little red  cap shining and then he made two snips more and the little girl sprang out crying ah how frightened have been how dark it was inside the wolf and after that the aged grandmother came out alive also but scarcely able to breathe red cap however quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the wolfs belly and when he awoke he wanted to run away but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at once and fell dead
then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice to see that snowdrop still lived and she dressed herself up again but in quite another dress from the one she wore before and took with her a poisoned comb when she reached the dwarfs cottage she knocked at the door and cried fine wares to sell but snowdrop said dare not let anyone in then the queen said only look at my beautiful combs and gave her the poisoned one and it looked so pretty that she took it up and put it into her hair to try it but the moment it touched her head the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless there you may lie said the queen and went her way but by good luck the dwarfs came in very early that evening and when they saw snowdrop lying on the ground they thought what had happened and soon found the poisoned comb and when they took it away she got well and told them all that had passed and they warned her once more not to open the door to anyone
meantime the queen went home to her glass and shook with rage when she read the very same answer as before and she said snowdrop shall die if it cost me my life so she went by herself into her chamber and got ready a poisoned apple the outside looked very rosy and tempting but whoever tasted it was sure to die then she dressed herself up as a peasants wife and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs cottage and knocked at the door but snowdrop put her head out of the window and said dare not let anyone in for the dwarfs have told me not do as you please said the old woman but at any rate take this pretty apple will give it you no said snowdrop dare not take it you silly girl answered the other what are you afraid of do you think it is poisoned come do you eat one part and will eat the other now the apple was so made up that one side was good though the other side was poisoned then snowdrop was much tempted to taste for the apple looked so very nice and when she saw the old woman eat she could wait no longer but she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth when she fell down dead upon the ground this time nothing will save thee said the queen and she went home to her glass and at last it said
thou queen art the fairest of all the fair
